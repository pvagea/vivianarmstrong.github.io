            <h2>Salmon River</h2>
            <p>The Salmon River is one of the rivers we take our adventures on. Known as "The River of No Return," the
                Salmon River originates in the Sawtooth and Lemhi Valleys of central and eastern Idaho; snows from the
                Sawtooth and Salmon River Mountains in the south and the Clearwater and Bitterroot Mountains in the
                north feed this river. The upper section passes through the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness,
                while the lower section forms the southern boundary of the Gospel-Hump Wilderness. In recognition of the
                river's many outstanding values, including scenery, recreation, geology, fish, wildlife, water quality,
                botany, prehistory, history and cultural traditional use, Congress designated 46 miles of the river,
                from North Fork to Corn Creek, as a recreational river and 79 miles, from Corn Creek to Long Tom Bar, as
                a wild river. To continue to article from <a class="link"

            <h2>Snake River</h2>
            <p>The Snake River is the second river we love to go on our adventrues. The Snake River likely got its name
                from the first European explorers who misinterpreted the sign made by the Shoshone people who identified
                themselves in sign language by moving the hand in a swimming motion which appeared to these explorers to
                be a "snake." It actually signified that they lived near the river with many fish. In the 1950's, the
                name "Hells Canyon" was borrowed from Hells Canyon Creek, which enters the river near what is now Hells
                Canyon Dam.

                The Hells Canyon area was once home to Shoshone and Nez Perce tribes. According to the Nez Perce tribe,
                Coyote dug the Snake River Canyon in a day to protect the people on the west side of the river from the
                Seven Devils, a band of evil spirits living in the mountain range to the east. In the late nineteenth
                century, the military drove the Native Americans out and settlers began ranching and mining in the
                canyon. Today, boaters can explore archaeological sites and old homesteads, all part of the canyon's
                rich, colorful history.This article is from <a class="link"
